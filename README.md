#  Real-Time Hand Gesture Recognition using MediaPipe & Machine Learning

ðŸŽ¥ Overview

This project detects and classifies hand gestures (Rock , Paper , Scissors  ) in real-time from a video using MediaPipe for hand tracking and a trained machine learning model for classification. 
It supports detecting two hands simultaneously and overlays the predicted class labels on the video.
